        <p id="timeOfDay"></p>
        <p>My name is Kaz Tollenaar. I am a Dutch game designer, programmer and artist. As you might have guessed, this is my portfolio; here, I showcase my work for the rest of the world to see.</p>
        
        <h1>What I do:</h1>
        <p>My primary directive on this Earth is to create games. To this end, I have taken up many different disciplines (with varying degrees of success) to forge games with, such as design theory, programming, 2D art, 3D modelling and animation, sound and music design and narrative design.</p>
        <p>I am currently studying Game Design at the LUCA School of Arts in Genk, Belgium, where I expect to graduate as a Master in the Audiovisual Arts in 2019.</p>
        
        <h1>My approach to game design:</h1>
        <p>Anyone who tells you they make fantastic games through their 'instincts' or 'intricate knowledge of game design' is lying. Good games are made through taking an idea, prototyping it, giving it to a group of playtesters, getting it thrown back in your face and then fixing everything that didn't work. Over and over and over again, until you run out of money. So my approach isn't anything 'deep' or 'intellectual'. It's just to keep on iterating, and not to be afraid to ditch elements that don't work. As they say: "If a job is worth doing, it's worth doing twice."</p>

        <h1>My skill set:</h1>
        <p>While I am experienced in many facets of game development, I would say that my speciality is <a href="/programming/">programming</a>, as that is what I do best. My primary programming language is C#, which I use both in conjunction with the Unity Engine (see <a href="/projects/fired">You're Fired!</a>) as well as to write my own game engines (see <a href="/projects/obelisk">Obelisk</a>). Besides that, I can also work with JavaScript, PHP, Lua and HTML, the latter of which I used to write this very portfolio that you are reading!</p>
        <p>In terms of art, I'm still very much in a learning stage (but then again, you never really finish that course, do you?), although I would venture as far to say I can get a decent drawing done once every so often. Don't take my word for it, of course, <a href="/2d/">see for yourself</a>. <!-- I can also produce the odd, vaguely realistic 3D model, complete with animations, which you can see <a href="/3d/">here</a>.--></p>

        <h1>My interests:</h1>
        <p>I'm a man of many different tastes, a fair share of which are poor. Obviously, I love playing and creating games, of all sorts. Shooters, puzzle games, MOBAs, RPGs, platformers, sandboxes, you name it. I'm particularly fond of everything Valve made when they still made games: the <cite>Half-Life</cite> series, the <cite>Portal</cite> series, <cite>Team Fortress 2</cite> and <cite>DotA 2</cite>. The best game of all time of course remains the original <cite>Fable</cite> by Lionhead Studios. If I had to name the one single thing that got me into game development, then that would be it. If I ever got to work on another instalment (a <i>proper</i> one this time around), I could die a happy man.</p>
        <p>Besides all that, I'm hugely interested music: I'm particularly fond of rock music, with the Dire Straits, Pink Floyd and David Bowie leading the charge, but I like loads of other genres as well. I also play the piano, be it very poorly, and I have a decent singing voice, which I like to use whenever I think no one is in earshot.</p>
        <p>Apart from music I'm also a huge fan of British and Irish comedies, such as <cite>Blackadder</cite>, <cite>Father Ted</cite>, and pretty much anything by Rik Mayall. I also like ranting about politics, although unfortunately no one ever seems to want to join in. I also really enjoy helping people with coding, or anything else they're having trouble with. If the whole game developer thing doesn't work out, I might even become a teacher. Or even a game development teacher. I believe we have a few of those wandering around the campus.</p>
